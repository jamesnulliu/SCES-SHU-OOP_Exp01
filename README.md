# SCES-SHU-OOP_Exp01
Experiment 01: C-strings of OOP courses in School of Computer Engineering and Science Shanghai University.

# 1. C-Strings
There is a bunch of questions in the project provied by the course.
I wrote the answers in a .docx file and made a compeletly same copy of .pdf file.

# 2. QuaEquOneVar
## Brief
This is a project to solve unary quadratic equations based on MSCV written in C++.
## Environment
The executable file should be run on a windows x64 or window x86 platform.
## Source Code
1. If Visual Studio 2022, you can open the project by directly running the .sln file.
2. If others, you should build your own project. Pay attention to the directory tree. 
   All the .cpp files should be in folder named "source" while all the .h files should be in folder "header".
   Those 2 folders should be in the same directory.

# 3. License
The project(including the answers to the questions, **excluding the folder of "C-string"** which is provied by SCES-SHU) is based on **APACHE LICENSE VERSION 2.0**.
If you have better opinions or questions to any part of the project, you can pull a request or mail me at [jamesnulliu@outlook.com](jamesnulliu@outlook.com).
